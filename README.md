Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

We have developed a web application which will predict the price of the stocks based on the historical data by using machine learning and its algorithms.

We have used several algorithms like LSTM algorithm, Na√Øve bayes algorithm.

Basically, the analysis is of two types -
-	Technical analysis
-	Sentimental analysis
  
Technical analysis -
	Technical analysis is a method used to evaluate and forecast the future price movements of financial assets, such as stocks, currencies, commodities, or indices, based on historical price and volume data. It involves analysing patterns, trends, and statistical indicators derived from the asset's historical price and volume information, without necessarily considering the fundamental factors affecting the asset.

Sentimental Analysis -
	Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or subjective opinion expressed in a piece of text, such as a review, social media post, or customer feedback. It involves analysing and categorizing the text as positive, negative, or neutral to understand the overall sentiment conveyed by the author.

Extract Tweets using Twitter API: 
   The Twitter API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of tools and functionalities provided by Twitter that allows developers to interact with the Twitter platform programmatically. It enables developers to access and retrieve data from Twitter, post tweets, interact with user accounts, and perform various other operations.
